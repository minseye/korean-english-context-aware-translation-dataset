## ðŸ“Š **Dataset Overview**

This dataset is designed to evaluate Korean-to-English **discourse-level** translation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems. It consists of **600 manually constructed text instances** that highlight six linguistic phenomena requiring **contextual inference beyond the sentence level**.

Unlike sentence-level datasets, this dataset emphasizes **inter-sentential (cross-sentence) context** that is necessary to resolve ambiguities and accurately translate challenging linguistic phenomena.

## ðŸ§© **Linguistic Phenomena Covered**

1. **Lexical Ambiguity**  
   Words with multiple meanings that need context across sentences to resolve correctly.

2. **Zero Anaphora**  
   Omitted subjects, objects, or complements that require inference from preceding or following sentences.

3. **Slang**  
   Informal expressions where inter-sentential context helps in understanding the tone and meaning.

4. **Idiom**  
   Phrases with non-literal meanings that can only be accurately translated by considering the broader discourse.

5. **Figurative Language**  
   Metaphors or expressions requiring context from surrounding sentences to be properly interpreted.

6. **Implicature**  
   Implied meanings where the intention becomes clear only when considering the entire conversation.
